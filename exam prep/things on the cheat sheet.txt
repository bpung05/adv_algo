things on the cheat sheet:


1. Post  discussion about sort algoirhtms. Analyse sort algorithms. Discover a new algorithm with some conditions. Characteristic? Yes or No?
2. 1 graph -> perform DFS on this graph. Order of the nodes you vists (4.4 , 4.3, 4.1). Given GRAPH
3. and BFS. 
4.Strongly connected components - Kosraju -> GRAPH
6. Max flow -> There will be one on Capacity and one on augmented paths.
7. MST (?) -> GRAPH
8. Dijkstras/Prims/Kurskal spanning tree. CHeck and discuss the negative weights - FR
9. Shortest path algorithm. Check the shortest path. Characterstics. different conditions?
10. Another about dijkstraas
11. Check the bellmn-ford shortest path algorithm



1.TOSSUP -> its a sort/new algo   
2. DFS ORDERING ->GRAPH
3. Can we use the BFS algorithm to determine whether a graph is cyclic? If so, how? 

	OR

COMPARE TIME COMPLEXITY Between DFS and BFS

4.In the Kosaraju strongly connected component algorithm, what is the purpose of the first three steps?

OR SCC GRAPH 

OR TARJANS

5. prim, kruskal (probably discussion on differences or when one is better)
6.What is an augmenting path? If there is one, how do you find it? (NO GRAPH HERE)
7.MST with graph. Use Kruskals or dijkstras.
8. DJKSTRA NEGATIVE EDGES : Does the Dijkstra-Prim Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm work for mixed positive and negative edge weights? Why or why not?

9. SHORTEST PATH - DIJKSTRAS ->GRAPH ?????

10.  Can the Bellman Ford algorithm be used to find the maximum-length simple path in a graph? If it will not work in the general case, is there a special case for which it will work?
